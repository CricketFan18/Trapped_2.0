Folder: Assets/Plugins
Purpose:
3rd party assets and plugins (DoTween, Cinemachine extras, vendor SDKs). Avoid mixing custom code here.
Guidelines:
- Prefer clear names and stable structure.
- Keep zone-specific items inside their zone folders.
- Keep code in Assets/_Game/Scripts and prefabs in Assets/_Game/Prefabs.
