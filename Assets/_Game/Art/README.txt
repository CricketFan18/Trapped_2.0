Folder: Assets/_Game/Art
Purpose:
All art assets that are NOT prefabs: models, textures, materials, shaders, source art exports.
Guidelines:
- Prefer clear names and stable structure.
- Keep zone-specific items inside their zone folders.
- Keep code in Assets/_Game/Scripts and prefabs in Assets/_Game/Prefabs.
