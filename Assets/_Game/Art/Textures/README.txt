Folder: Assets/_Game/Art/Textures
Purpose:
Textures: albedo, normal, ORM, masks, UI atlases. Keep naming consistent and include resolution/usage if helpful.
Guidelines:
- Prefer clear names and stable structure.
- Keep zone-specific items inside their zone folders.
- Keep code in Assets/_Game/Scripts and prefabs in Assets/_Game/Prefabs.
