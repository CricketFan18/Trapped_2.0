Folder: Assets/_Game/Art/Materials
Purpose:
Unity materials (and related shader graphs) used by models/prefabs. Prefer reusable, named by usage (M_Wood, M_Metal...).
Guidelines:
- Prefer clear names and stable structure.
- Keep zone-specific items inside their zone folders.
- Keep code in Assets/_Game/Scripts and prefabs in Assets/_Game/Prefabs.
