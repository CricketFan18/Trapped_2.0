Folder: Assets/_Game/Prefabs/Core
Purpose:
Core/manager prefabs: GameManager, AudioManager, SaveSystem, bootstrap objects. Minimal, stable dependencies.
Guidelines:
- Prefer clear names and stable structure.
- Keep zone-specific items inside their zone folders.
- Keep code in Assets/_Game/Scripts and prefabs in Assets/_Game/Prefabs.
