Folder: Assets/_Game/Prefabs/Boss
Purpose:
Boss area prefabs: boss entity, arena props, hazards, VFX hooks, boss-specific puzzle parts.
Guidelines:
- Prefer clear names and stable structure.
- Keep zone-specific items inside their zone folders.
- Keep code in Assets/_Game/Scripts and prefabs in Assets/_Game/Prefabs.
