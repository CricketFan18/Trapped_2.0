Folder: Assets/_Game/Prefabs/UI
Purpose:
UI prefabs: screens, panels, widgets, HUD elements. Avoid putting scripts here—scripts go in Scripts/UI.
Guidelines:
- Prefer clear names and stable structure.
- Keep zone-specific items inside their zone folders.
- Keep code in Assets/_Game/Scripts and prefabs in Assets/_Game/Prefabs.
