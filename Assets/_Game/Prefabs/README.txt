Folder: Assets/_Game/Prefabs
Purpose:
All prefabs: gameplay objects, environment pieces, UI prefabs. Subfolders separate by ownership/area.
Guidelines:
- Prefer clear names and stable structure.
- Keep zone-specific items inside their zone folders.
- Keep code in Assets/_Game/Scripts and prefabs in Assets/_Game/Prefabs.
