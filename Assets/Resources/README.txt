Folder: Assets/Resources
Purpose:
Unity Resources folder (loaded via Resources.Load). Use sparingly; prefer Addressables when scaling.
Guidelines:
- Prefer clear names and stable structure.
- Keep zone-specific items inside their zone folders.
- Keep code in Assets/_Game/Scripts and prefabs in Assets/_Game/Prefabs.
